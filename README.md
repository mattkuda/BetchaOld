### Recommended Installs:
#### Nodemon
Replacement wrapper for node which automatically restarts the node application when new changes are saved. To install, enter *npm install -g nodemon* into the terminal.
### Running the NodeJS Server:
1. Clone the repository.
2. From inside the *server* directory, enter either *node index.js* or *nodemon index.js* into the terminal. The server should begin listening for incoming requests on port 4000. The server will also connect to the MongoDB database at this time.
